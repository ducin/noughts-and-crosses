noughts-and-crosses
===================

This repository holds a python package implementing a simple socket game,
[Noughts and Crosses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

First you shall run the server, and then the client:

    $ ./nac/server.py
    $ ./nac/client.py

You will see the game board represented by few console lines:

    (0)|(1)|(2)
    ---+---+---
    (3)|(4)|(5)
    ---+---+---
    (6)|(7)|(8)

Enter the position you want to put your mark:

Your move: 0

     X |(1)|(2)
    ---+---+---
    (3)|(4)|(5)
    ---+---+---
    (6)|(7)|(8)

The server is 'X' and the client is 'O'.
